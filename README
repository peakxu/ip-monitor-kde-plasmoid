This is a KDE plasmoid that simply shows IPv4 addresses
of all the network interfaces available on the system.

=INSTALL=========

Before you can use the plasmoid, make sure you have following
dependencies:

Build deps:
- KDE Development library (either from Git or precompiled package from your distribution)
- Qt Development library (this is a dependency for above, and hence will mostly be installed automatically)

Runtime deps:
- KDE Plasma Workspace (to load the plasmoid on!)

To install the plasmoid, build (and install) by following
commands:

$ cd ip_monitor/
$ cmake .
$ make
$ su -c 'make install'
$ kbuildsycoca4

If there were no errors during build, the plasmoid should be
ready to use and can be loaded from KDE Plasma Workspace as usual.
